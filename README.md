This repo contains 3 files :
1. project0.ipynb
2. placement.csv
3. model.pkl

I developed this program to build a decision model to predict whether a student is going to be placed or not on the basis of their IQ and CGPA (independent features).

This is not a functional machine learning program as it only builds the decision model around the dataset and export the model as "model.pkl" using pickle library.
